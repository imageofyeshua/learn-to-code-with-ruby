  Our Father in heaven
  Sanctified be Thy Name
  Thy kingdom come
  Thy will be done on earth 
  As it is in heaven
  Give us this day our daily bread
  Forgive us our debts
  As we also forgive our debtors
  Do not lead us into temptation
  But deliver us from evil one
  For Thine is the kingdom
  And the power
  And the glory
  Forever, Amen
